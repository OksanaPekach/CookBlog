                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Milk powder for your baked goods</strong><br>
                                Use milk powder to give your baked goods an added depth of dairy flavor. </li>
                            <li><strong>Mayonnaise for fish to prevent it from sticking</strong><br>
                                Brush your fish with mayonnaise it is an easy way to make sure delicate fish fillets
                                don't stick to the grill and rip apart. </li>
                            <li><strong>Mayonnaise for your scrambled eggs</strong><br>
                                Cheefs suggests adding a dollop of mayonnaise instead. This added dose of fat keeps the
                                scramble moist and creamy without changing the flavor, so mayo-haters can try this trick
                                without worrying.</li>
                            <li><strong>Caramelized white chocolate</strong><br>
                                Most people roast white chocolate directly in the oven, stirring it every now and then
                                to prevent burning, but you can also do it much faster in the microwave. Just microwave
                                the chocolate in 30-second increments, stirring in-between each, until it reaches your
                                desired color.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use silica packets in cooking</strong><br>
                                Silica packets are the perfect thing to keep delicate baked goods (such as sugar candies
                                or shortbread cookies) dry and prevent them from getting soggy. Just place a silica
                                packet in the same container you're storing your baked goods in and they'll stay nice
                                and dry.</li>

                            <h2>Weight Loss Ideas</h2>
                        </div>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Drink Water, Especially Before Meals</strong><br>
                                Drinking water can boost metabolism by 24–30% over a period of 1–1.5 hours, helping you
                                burn off a few more calories .
                                One study showed that drinking a half-liter (17 ounces) of water about half an hour
                                before meals helped dieters eat fewer calories and lose 44% more weight, compared to
                                those who didn’t drink the water. </li>
                            <li><strong>Eat Eggs For Breakfast</strong><br>
                                Eating whole eggs can have all sorts of benefits, including helping you lose weight.
                                Studies show that replacing a grain-based breakfast with eggs can help you eat fewer
                                calories for the next 36 hours as well as lose more weight and body fat </li>
                            <li><strong>Drink Green Tea</strong><br>
                                Though green tea contains small amounts of caffeine, it is loaded with powerful
                                antioxidants called catechins, which are believed to work synergistically with caffeine
                                to enhance fat burning (9, 10Trusted Source).
                                Although the evidence is mixed, many studies show that green tea (either as a beverage
                                or a green tea extract supplement) can help you lose weight </li>
                        </ol>

                            <h2>Freeze fruit hacks</h2>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Choose materials for Freezing Produce</strong><br>
                                Rigid plastic containers, glass containers, and jars come in handy for liquid or
                                semi-solid foods, sauces, jams, and other preserves.
                                You also can use freezer paper, freezer tape, and heavy-duty foil. They come in handy
                                for packaging certain foods and for long-term storage. Long term means longer than the
                                typical 6-12 months. The longer you store the food in the freezer, the more the quality
                                declines, but it is still perfectly fine to eat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Fruits & Vegetables for Freezing</strong><br>
                                You’ll want to wash all fruits and vegetables well, especially if you don’t plan on
                                peeling them, and pat them dry with a paper towel or dishtowel. Some fruits and
                                vegetables can be frozen whole, while others need to be peeled, pitted, and/or cut into
                                smaller pieces. </li>
                            <li><strong>Maintain the color and nutrients.</strong><br>
                                This will help with that, but it also helps maintain the color and nutrients, as well as
                                killing any surface organisms that could lead to spoilage. Corn (though you could),
                                tomatoes, onions, potatoes (including sweet), and winter squash don’t need to be
                                blanched. And neither do fruits.
                                Most vegetables also need to be blanched before freezing.</li>
                            <li><strong> Label & Store Frozen Produce</strong><br>
                                You must to label the bags and containers with the date and the contents. You might
                                think you’ll remember what it is, but six months down the road it might be more
                                difficult to remember what was in each bag or container. Freezer tape will stay on the
                                containers despite the cold temperature and the moisture. I like to run tape around the
                                containers too, to keep out air and prevent hoar frost. Wrapping bags and containers in
                                foil and taping will also help with that.</li>
